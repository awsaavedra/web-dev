1.react class: defines the form and function of a react component

    the class MUST always have a render method that must always return JSX



2. We instantiated the class (hello world class)


3. Finally, we inserted that into the DOM using the react render method

  remember: the react render method is JUST for putting the component instances
  into the DOM
